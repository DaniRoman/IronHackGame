# IronHackGame

### ___What it does?___
  . This is the first Ironhack project, as it name does is a game deployed in git pages where you can play it.

### ***Used technologies***
  . Implemented with vanilla JavasCript to assimilate and put into practice the basic and advanced Js methods and concepts as OOP, advanced array          methods... 

### ***Challenges faced***
  . Implementing a method of changing state where the player changes movement depending on the key pressed has been a challenge, which I'd like to explore further and implement with other game features.
The main function used to render on loop the game is a  


### ***features to implement in the future***
 . I'd like implent new stages, final boss, and more state changes when the monsters are dying.
 
###  ***How to Use the Project***
 . Just go to the pages and play the game, press the start button on the arcade machine to start, stop to restart the game from the beginning or in case of death restart to appear in the same place. 
Use the arrow keys to move the player left, right, up to jump and down to crouch, control key to attack, some of the enemies only appear when the user moves so the faster you move the more enemies will appear. The player wins when he reaches a certain amount of score by killing monsters it's an easy mod so you only need to kill a few :) or die if you get hit 3 times, enjoy it!!!.
